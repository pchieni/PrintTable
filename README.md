PrintTable
==========

A project that converts a php associative array and prints a table

 TO RUN DO THE FOLLOWING
 
 1) Copy the folder 'Print Table' to xampp/htdoc directory of xampp server
 2) I have used 'simpletest' for unit testing. It needs to be in the same directory as the 'Print Table'
 3) Then you can proceed on to start xampp and run
     'http://localhost/PrintTable/TestCase.php'
